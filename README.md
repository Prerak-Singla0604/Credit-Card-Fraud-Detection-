# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project is a machine learning model built to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle and applies multiple classification algorithms to optimize for the best accuracy.

## ðŸš§ Project Overview
The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate based on several anonymized features from the dataset.

## ðŸ“ˆ Dataset Overview
The dataset includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Over two days, 492 frauds were detected out of 284,807 transactions, making the dataset highly imbalanced, with the positive class (fraud) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions. All features except `Time` and `Amount` have been transformed using PCA for confidentiality purposes.
